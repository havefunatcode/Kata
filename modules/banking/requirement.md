# Banking Kata

This kata is about replacing an old COBOL accounting software with a modern one, using TDD.

## Requirements

Write a class `Account` that offers the following methods:
*   `void deposit(int)`
*   `void withdraw(int)`
*   `String printStatement()`

An example statement would be:

| Date       | Amount | Balance |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 24.12.2015 | +500   | 500     |
| 23.8.2016  | -100   | 400     |
